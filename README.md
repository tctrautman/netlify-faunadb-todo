## Netlify + FaunaDB

This is an implementation of the [Netlify + FaunaDB tutorial](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-faunadb-example). It was an interesting way to see how one could build a persistent stateful React app using Netlify to host and run backend functions via AWS Lambda, and using FaunaDB as a database.
