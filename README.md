## Netlify + FaunaDB

This is an implementation of the [Netlify + FaunaDB tutorial](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-faunadb-example). It was a useful way to see how one could build a stateful Gatsby.js / React app, using Netlify to host and orchestrate AWS Lambda functions, and using FaunaDB as the database for a serverless application.
